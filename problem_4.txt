What is the difference between an interpreted and a compiled language?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?
Give an example of each, and list a situation for each where a developer should choose one over the other.

Well an interpreted language is stuff like Javascript where you write the code and it stays in a file until needed to be read by an
interpreter. While a compliled language something like Java, you don't need any interpreter because you compile the code into in Java's case
an exe.

If you want to write something in Javascript you would use an interpreted, most web stuff use interpreted while most softwares use
compiled.

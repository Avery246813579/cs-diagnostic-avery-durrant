Headers
REST

Alright when you type the web address your computer (the client) will send a GET request to whatever domain you have with headers.
The domain will then run threw a dns to get the ip address. Once you get the ip address the GET request will go to the server and
the server will return something. If you wanted to connect with a packet it's a constant stream opposed to a request-response
system that websites do. REST is part of the Restful routes and they are used for apis and stuff. HTTP and HTTPS or protocols
and HTTP on :80 and HTTPS on :443. HTTP is secured while HTTP is not. TCP is a way of protecting data and stuff. Yeah
